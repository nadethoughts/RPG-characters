# *Arcane Cascade*

Requirements You used your most recent action this turn to Cast a Spell or make a Spellstrike.

You divert a portion of the spell's magical power and keep it cycling through your body and weapon using specialized forms, breathing, or footwork. While you're in the stance, your melee Strikes deal 1 extra force damage. Any Strike that benefits from this damage is magical.

If your most recent spell before entering the stance was one that can deal damage, the damage from the stance is instead the same type that spell could deal (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage).

## feat 2
-
; General, Skill
**Prerequisites** trained in Survival
-
Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can *Track* while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your Survival check. If you're a master in Survival, you don't take the –5 penalty. If you're legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.

# Focus Spells ((Title))
##### Source Player Core pg. 298

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, just like cantrips are. Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point. The maximum number of points in your pool is equal to the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is lower. This counts only spells that require Focus Points to cast.

You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain 1 Focus Point. You can Refocus multiple times to regain multiple points, up to your pool's maximum.

You briefly turn your attack into pure force to bypass your opponent's defenses. Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding. If you can use *Spellstrike* with a ranged weapon (with the starlit span hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon. For an instant, you transform your weapon or unarmed attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The force fang automatically deals ***2d4+1 force damage*** to the target.

# Occult Spells (Psychic Dedication) ((Title))
##### Source Player Core pg. 297
If you’re a spontaneous spellcaster—such as a bard—you choose which spell from your spell repertoire that you’re using a spell slot for at the moment you decide to cast it. This provides you with more freedom in your spellcasting, but you have fewer spells in your spell repertoire, as determined by your character level and class. When you make your daily preparations, all your spell slots are refreshed, but you don’t get to change the spells in your repertoire.

### Amp
you use your Focus Points to boost or modify your psi cantrips by applying amps—specialized thoughtforms that alter the expression of your psychic power. Each of your psi cantrips has a special amp heading. Whenever you cast a psi cantrip, you can amp it by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect.

# Arcane Spells (Magus & Wizard Dedication) ((Title))
##### Source Player Core pg. 297
You're a prepared spellcaster. You must spend time each day preparing spells for that day. At the start of your daily preparations, you select a number of spells of different spell ranks, determined by your character level and class. Your spells remain prepared until you cast them or until you prepare spells again.

Each prepared spell is expended after a single casting, so if you want to cast a particular spell more than once in a day, you need to prepare that spell multiple times. The exception to this rule is for spells with the cantrip trait; once you prepare a cantrip, you can cast it as many times as you want until the next time you prepare spells. See page 298 for more information on cantrips.

Superheated air collects under you, buoying you high into the sky before you plummet back down in a fiery comet. You Fly 15 feet straight up into the air, then Fly in a straight line to an empty space of your choice on the ground within 60 feet. When you land, the blistering air blasts out from you, dealing 3d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save) to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation.
