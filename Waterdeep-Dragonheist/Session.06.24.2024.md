# Chase of the Nimblewright

## Location: Temple of Shananooah

## **Starting Location**
### Trollskull Tavern

# Preamble
* Would we like to switch games/systems every adventure?!
    * Something I really wanted to do back in college is have a consistent gaming group that we could test out different systems with. Play an adventure with a system, then see if we want to keep playing that system for another adventure, if not, switch to a new one.
    * Usually there is at least 1 person who is only interested in playing the game that we are currently playing, but I think that this group might be a good one for doing that style of game.
* ***Everyone Starts with 1 point of inspiration***
 
# Review the characters.
## Dave - Aric Greenbuttle
halfling Rogue (untrained in sneaking)
## Derek - Leaf
Human Paladin (Definitely _not_ a pirate)
## Ian - Nortbert
Half Elf Druid (on a mission to find a missing artifact)
## Ramsey - Iados
Tiefling Sorcerer (bit of a coward)

# Create a strong start.
## Finding the nimblewright
* Being shooed out of the Grallhund's Manor, the party only have 1 lead for the gold. They must find that nimbelwrite.
    * how are you going to approach the search?

# Outline potential scenes. 
* The nimblewright can be found in an alley under some trash, having already accoumplished it's goal.
    * [The Stone of Galorr](Objects/stone-of-golorr.md) is not with the Nimblewright
    * The Nimblewright fights to the death.
    * After the fight ends, the city watch (6 Vetrans) arrive and will believe any story the characters come up with about the nimblewrite. (constructs have no rights)

    * **Loot** the Niblewright has a Map on it's person with an "X" on it over in the Dockward and the name "Grinda Garloth" on it.

## Grinda's House (Towns and Taverns Book 2 Page 10)
* Under attack from members of the Xanathar Guild for refusing to hand over the [Stone of Galorr](Objects/stone-of-golorr.md)
* **What She did with it?** Gave to her *rat familiar* to hide the stone in her families crypt. Located in the **City of the Dead**.

## Off to the **City of the Dead**
* *Aric* and *Leaf* know that the **City of the Dead** is Guarded. 
* On their way to the **City of the Dead** the Characters are followed by a *gazer* (for Xanathar to figure out where the stone is) 
    * *Stealth: **19** against Charactes Passive Perception to discover it*

## Mausoleum (Encounter 4)
* If caught the Players will be escorted out and the city guard will be informed
    * DC for getting around the Grave Yard will me much harder as the guards on on high alert

* The Door is unlocked

* The Mausoleum is already broken into with the [Stone of Galorr](Objects/stone-of-golorr.md) no where to be seen as well as the remains of [Grinda's](NPCs/grinda-garloth.md) ancestors.
* Upon Searching the Crypt, they do find a clue as to who the grave robbers are.
    * Characters who search the underground crypts can find a shiny steel key lying in the dust on the floor. One of the grave robbers dropped it while looting the crypts.
* When leaving the crypt, the players are Jumped by 4 Duergar **Xanathar Guild Members**


## What about the Key?
* Some lock smith can identify the key as the handiwork of a dwarf locksmith in the Trades Ward named [Elaspra Ulmarr](../Waterdeep-Dragonheist/NPCs/elaspra-ulmarr.md). 
* From [Elaspra](NPCs/elaspra-ulmarr.md) or her records, the characters learn that she sold the key to a man named [Volkarr Kibbens](NPCs/volkarr-kibbens.md), whose address is an old windmill in the Southern Ward. The key unlocks the door to his apartment, which he shares with another man named [Urlaster Ghann](NPCs/urlaster-ghann).
