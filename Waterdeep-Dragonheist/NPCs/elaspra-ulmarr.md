# Elaspra Ulmarr


* Characters who visit Elaspra's shop can learn from her that she made a key for a client who bought one of her excellent locks. She even installed the lock for him. 
* Elaspra won't easily divulge the name of the client or his place of residence. 

## Solution
* **Harpers** She has great respect for the Harpers, however; 
    * A character who can prove that they belong to the Harpers can attempt a **DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion)** check. 
    * A character **pretending to be a Harper** can fool her with a successful **DC 16 Charisma (Deception)** check.

* Otherwise, the characters must either compel Elaspra to release the information using magic, 
* they must sneak a peek at her records, which she keeps in an iron safe that can be opened with a **knock spell**. 
    * To pick the combination lock on the safe, a character must **succeed on three DC 20 Dexterity (Investigation) checks** in a row. Each attempt made to pick the lock requires an action.
